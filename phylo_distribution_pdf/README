The folder contains visualizations of phylogenetic trees of the bacteria and archeae.

phylogenetic trees were taken from GTDB r202 database.
Each leaf on the tree represents a family with genera. 
Each genus is shown as a circle colored accordingly with the type and number of rotary ATPases encoded in the genome of representative species.
Color coding for the ATPases is show in the picture ATPase_legend.png

Bacterial tree is splitted into several parts. Ten big phyla are shown separetely. 
Other tree parts are named with included phyla. 
The most comprehensive bacterial tree part is Other_bacteria.pdf that includes notes on collapsed branches that are shown separately.
